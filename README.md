# CS5230_Vehicle_Cybersecurity
Our intent is to build upon the combined integration of the 3 simulators, Sumo, Carla, and Artery.

Malicious CAM and DENM messages will be injected (from a python program) along with realistic messages from Artery.

This allows for the simultaneous simulation of both real and fake messages in a V2X network. 

The simulated attacks from the group’s CAM injections will include: Position Attack and Offset Attack. 
The simulated DENM attacks will include: Emergency Braking Attack, Traffic Jam Attack, and Traction Loss Attack
