# CS5230_Vehicle_Cybersecurity
Our intent is to build upon the combined integration of the 3 simulators, Sumo, Carla, and Artery. Malicious CAM and DENM messages will be injected (from a python program) along with realistic messages from Artery. This allows for the simultaneous simulation of both real and fake messages in a V2X network.
